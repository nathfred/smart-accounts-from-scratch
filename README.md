# Smart Account From Scratch

This repository is built as part of the **"Account Abstraction From Scratch"** course. It contains a hands-on implementation of smart account concepts on Ethereum, structured into four parts.

## 🧠 What This Is

A guided exercise for learning and implementing **Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)** in Solidity using the Hardhat development environment. Whether you're new to smart contracts or looking to deepen your knowledge, this repo breaks things down step by step.

## 📚 Structure

The repository is divided into **four parts**, each focusing on a different aspect of account abstraction:

1. [Part 1: Introduction to Smart Accounts](./part1)
2. [Part 2: Entry Point Contract](./part2)
3. [Part 3: User Operation and Validation](./part3)
4. [Part 4: Bundler and Simulation](./part4)

*(Folders may differ depending on your actual structure — you can edit this to match.)*

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and install dependencies like any typical Hardhat project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-account-from-scratch.git
cd smart-account-from-scratch
npm install

To compile:

npx hardhat compile

To test:

npx hardhat test

```

## 📦 Requirements

1. Node.js (v16+ recommended)
2. npm or yarn
3. Hardhat CLI

## 📖 Learning Objectives
1. Understand the core of Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)
2 Build and interact with smart accounts
3. Dive deep into how user operations and entry points work
4. Simulate real-world AA workflows with bundlers
